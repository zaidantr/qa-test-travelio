## Lessons Learned

While building this project, I gained the following insights:

- I hadn't touched Python Selenium since last year; it turns out my Chrome driver is outdated (version 114) because my current Chrome version is 122. After searching for some solutions, I downgraded my Chrome version to 114 so the Chrome driver can work properly.
- I also separated credential data in JSON, so I didn't push it to GitHub.
- I'm pretty happy with the HTML code of this website because it's easy to locate the elements. The website is very suitable for automation.
- Because I tested on the Production environment, I didn't see any dummy data, so I could peacefully verify anything I wanted.
